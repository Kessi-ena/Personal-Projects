ATM Machine Simulator

A C program to enable bank customers to manage their PIN on an ATM. The
PIN is any 4-digit number. It is assumed that the customerâ€™s default PIN has been 1234 but the
program enables the customer to change their PIN, display the amount of times they entered the 
correct PIN and Incorrect PIN, and allows the customer to exit the program.



Modulator

A tool I use to calculate how much percentage I need in my exam or assignment, or any other
component of a module that I don't have results for currently.  Instead of using brainpower to try figure it
all out I can just put in the numbers and the program will do the calculation for me and tell me how much I
need to pass the module then I can have a grade goal.
